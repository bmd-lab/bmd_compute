## workflow-selector-macandwindows.ipynb

This notebook was the primary Atomate2/Jobflow/PowerSLURM interface before BMD Compute. It remains an important source of validated scientific behavior, especially for the original Burton Lab PBE relax/static workflow policy.

BMD Compute has now evolved beyond a direct notebook clone. The current application should be read as:

- preserved notebook policy where it remains valid
- intentionally changed policy where implementation and PowerSLURM testing exposed a better or safer rule
- newly added policy for capabilities that were not part of the original notebook interface

Examples:

- Preserved: Burton Lab PBE relax/final ENCUT policy, with 580 eV for relax stages and 620 eV for final/static-style stages.
- Preserved: browser-generated VASP previews should reflect the policy that will be used before submission.
- Changed after implementation/testing: stage-first workflows now represent mixed-theory sequences explicitly instead of relying on a single global workflow label.
- Changed after PowerSLURM validation: PBE Static -> SOC no longer propagates WAVECAR by default, because the copied collinear WAVECAR was not a reliable restart artifact for the validated SOC transition.
- Added after notebook development: HSE06 stage policy, HSE06 Band Structure, explicit SOC executable routing, remote-side result parsing, submission idempotency, and structured provenance.

When migrating or revising notebook behavior:

1. understand the notebook behavior
2. compare it with current PowerSLURM validation and BMD Compute policy
3. extract or update reusable backend modules
4. test the backend independently
5. connect it to the browser

Do not copy notebook code directly into FastAPI route handlers.
